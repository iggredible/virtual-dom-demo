# Virtual DOM Demo

Simple demo of virtual dom. By using virtual dom, we can target a specific component in DOM tree to update it without having to update the entire tree using diffing. I think good grasp of virtual dom is essential in modern frontend development (ie [React](https://reactjs.org/)).

# Starting Application

`npm run start`
